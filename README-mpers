To use mpers functionality, one should:

* typedef all of the target types which are compound
and not typedefed already;
* for each target type, include DEF_MPERS_TYPE(target_type_t),
these can be included conditionally;
* include MPERS_DEFS once;
* before inclusion of MPERS_DEFS include all important headers
(containing definitions of these types or other behaviour-affecting
defines).

Printers should be defined
as MPERS_PRINTER_DECL(return_type, function_name, args),
inside files that include MPERS_DEFS these printers should be called
as MPERS_FUNC_NAME(function_name)(args), in other files
they should be called just as function_name(args).

You can't define non-static functions in files containing MPERS_DEFS.
If this function is expected to always have mpers functionality, you should
define it as a mpers printer. If this function is not expected to have mpers
functionality, but the rest of file is, the function should be taken into
another file.
